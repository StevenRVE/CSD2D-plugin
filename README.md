# SvE-Chorus
This repository contains a chorus plugin for building plugins using the DPF framework.
Chorus plugin is inspired by the example plugins from DPF made by FalkTX.

Clone git repository
```
git clone https://github.com/StevenRVE/sve-chorus.git
```

Update DPF git submodule
```
cd sve-chorus

git submodule update --init --remote --recursive
```

If something is wrong with adding dpf, remove the submodule following the steps described here: https://gist.github.com/myusuf3/7f645819ded92bda6677#:~:text=To%20remove%20a,upvote%20this%20answer

<!-- TODO: Update this section with instructions for Marc/Ciska how to build and test plugin (trying to set up github actions for this -->

Huge thanks to FalkTX for creating the DPF framework and for the example plugins and helping me out with some questions I had.
